### API Security
* Most APIs involve user registration and logins, so you can track your app's users and grant them privileges. In the Planetary API, I want to allow registration for the planet discovering scientific community. In order to register a new planet or edit or delete an existing planet, you must be logged in. Listing the planets, planet details, and the registration endpoint itself will not require a login. There are several prebuilt login and user management plugins if you don't want to build one yourself. There's Flask-Login, which handles logging in, logging out, and session management. There's also Flask-User, which handles user registration, login, logout, and role based security, like the kind I mentioned earlier. When evaluating these plugins, remember traditionally Flask is used to make traditional template based websites.
* For API projects, I prefer to use a technology called JSON Web Tokens. Most of the time, the app talking to my API is going to be a web app written in something like React or Angular. It could also be a mobile app or a desktop app.
*  JSON Web Tokens, or JWT, is an open standard for authenticating and verifying JADA exchanges between two parties. There are libraries for working with JWT in most languages, including Python. I'm not going to go into too much depth on how it works. You can implement it black box style, which is what we'll do here.
