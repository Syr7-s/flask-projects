### Flask CRUD
* You should enter the order flask db_create and flask_seed to terminal
* we've done the heavy lifting for this already, we created two schema for each of the possibilities on our records that are getting returned, there's one for the users and one for the planets, and for the planets as well as the users, we made two of them for each one, we made one that was singular records and another that was a collection of records, so here we're going to be invoking the singular records, and I'll do that by typing result equals planet_schema.dump, and I'll dump the result. Next I'll go ahead and return that result via jsonify by just passing in result.data. If there was no match, then I want to do something slightly different, let's do return jsonify, we'll give him a message that says, that planet does not exist, and we'll set the return status code to 404, not found.
*  We have our add_planet endpoint but we really want to set this up so that you must be logged in in order to hit it. We know we're using JSON web tokens. Protecting your endpoint is actually very easy. I'm just going to add another decorator to the method signature here. I'll go ahead and put it right below the app.route definition. And I'm just going to type in the at symbol followed by jwt_required.
